### Installation

1. First of all, Python version 3.9 and above is required.
2. Secondly, create a virtual environment for Python 3 with `python3 -m venv venv` and then activate with `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. Install Dlib on Ubuntu as described [here](https://learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-ubuntu/)
4. Then, we need to install dependencies. Use `pip install pip-tools` and then run `pip-compile && pip-sync` (for Windows `python -m piptools compile && python -m piptools sync`) to install requirements from setup.py file.
